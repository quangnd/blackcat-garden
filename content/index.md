### ðŸ¤” Reflection
```why?
Three biggest benefits of reflection: 
1) Improved Self-Awareness, 
2) Goal Alignment, 
3) Prioritization
```

#### 3 things that went well

- Lived much more mindfulness (recognize my feeling better)
- Drink as little as possible (just one bottle of beer)
- Read English and Vietnamese version of book "Art of living" by [[Epictetus]]. Then build a small project [[Practice the art of living]] 
#### 3 things that need improvement

- Use my time better. I haven't had a schedule for daily or English learning yet.
- Wake up earlier.
- Spent more times for English communication skills

#### Did I stay aligned with my goals and priorities?

- Not really, my target is to focus on learning English. But I didn't spend much time for speaking
#### What surprised me?

- My wife's attitude. She seems unpleased with me.
- Work: I can't answer how much remaining work of application version so far.
- I **lost** 323$ in future trading :( 
#### What drained my energy?

- Cold weather. I slept early but I can't wake up. I was cold and had a kind of laziness.
- My mind on family relationship.
- My iphone 13 pro which I borrowed my grandmother few months ago has broken. It took me a lot of times to fix and money as well.
- Trading coin. I spent a lot of time to see the mobile screen for price actions.
#### What energized me?

- Had one running workout this week. I think better when I'm running.
- Write everyday
#### How can I make next week better?

- Only focus on one to three habits at the same time. I need to improve my life style.
- My priority is 1) Wake up early & 2) Practice English speaking
#### What systems should I build?

- Create [[ðŸ“… my English learning schedule]] based on idea [[Build a method for English learning]]
## ðŸ¥… Next week's goal 

```ad-question
title: Three goals
If you could only get three specific goals done this week, what would they be? How do they relate to your monthly initiatives and yearly OKRs?
```

- [x] Create [[ðŸ“… my English learning schedule]]
- [ ] Wake up early (target: 5:30 AM)
- [x] Log & reflect my day
